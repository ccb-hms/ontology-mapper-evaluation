# ontology-mapper-evaluation
Resources to reproduce the comparison of ontology mappings generated by text2term with:
- [UK Biobank to EFO](https://github.com/EBISPOT/EFO-UKB-mappings) phenotype mappings 
- [Biomappings](https://github.com/biopragmatics/biomappings) collection of community curated mappings 
- [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/downloads) mappings of biomedical terms to EFO

## Running the comparison code
The mapping comparison can be executed by running the Python script:

```python
python compare_ontology_mappings.py
```

### Inputs
The inputs for the comparison are: 

#### Benchmark mappings
- `data/UK_Biobank_master_file.tsv`: UK Biobank phenotype mappings, downloaded on 2024-03-14 ([URL](https://github.com/EBISPOT/EFO-UKB-mappings)).
- `data/biomappings.tsv`: Biomappings table, downloaded on 2024-04-08 ([URL](https://github.com/biopragmatics/biomappings)).
- `data/efo.ols.sssom.tsv`: mappings of various ontologies to EFO, downloaded on 2024-04-10 ([URL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/downloads)).

#### Target ontology
- `data/efo_edges.tsv`: table containing all pairs of asserted subsumptions between terms in EFO.
- `data/efo_entailed_edges.tsv`: table containing all pairs of entailed subsumptions between terms in EFO. 

### Outputs
The outputs of the comparison are, for each benchmark mapping set:

- `output/{dataset}_t2t_mappings.csv`: table containing the generated text2term mappings.
- `output/{dataset}_mappings.tsv`: table containing mappings extracted from the original dataset.
- `output/{dataset}_results.tsv`: table containing the results of the mappings' comparison.

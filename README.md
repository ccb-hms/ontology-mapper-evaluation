# ontology-mapper-evaluation
Resources to reproduce the comparison of ontology mappings generated by text2term with those from the GWAS Catalog database.

## Running the comparison code
The mapping comparison can be executed by running the Python script:

```python
python compare_ontology_mappings.py
```

### Inputs
The inputs needed for the comparison are: 

- `data/gwascatalog_metadata.tsv`: the GWAS Catalog metadata table, downloaded on 2024-02-06. 
- `data/efo_entailed_edges.tsv`: table containing all pairs of entailed subsumptions between terms in EFO. 

### Outputs
The outputs of the comparison are:

- `output/mappings_t2t.csv`: table containing the generated text2term mappings.
- `output/mappings_gwascatalog.tsv`: table containing mappings extracted from GWAS Catalog metadata.
- `output/mappings_comparison.tsv`: table containing the results of the mappings' comparison.

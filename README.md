# ontology-mapper-evaluation
Resources to reproduce the comparison of ontology mappings generated by text2term with those from the [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads) database, the [UK Biobank phenotype mapping set](https://github.com/EBISPOT/EFO-UKB-mappings), and the [Biomappings](https://github.com/biopragmatics/biomappings) collection of community curated mappings between named biological entities.

## Running the comparison code
The mapping comparison can be executed by running the Python script:

```python
python compare_ontology_mappings.py
```

### Inputs
The inputs for the comparison are: 

#### Benchmark mappings
- `data/gwascatalog_metadata.tsv`: the GWAS Catalog metadata table, downloaded on 2024-02-06 ([URL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/file-downloads)).
- `data/UK_Biobank_master_file.tsv`: UK Biobank phenotype mappings, downloaded on 2024-03-14 ([URL](https://github.com/EBISPOT/EFO-UKB-mappings)).
- `data/biomappings.tsv`: Biomappings table, downloaded on 2024-04-08 ([URL](https://github.com/biopragmatics/biomappings)).

#### Target ontology
- `data/efo_edges.tsv`: table containing all pairs of asserted subsumptions between terms in EFO.
- `data/efo_entailed_edges.tsv`: table containing all pairs of entailed subsumptions between terms in EFO. 

### Outputs
The outputs of the comparison are, for each benchmark mapping set:

- `output/{dataset}_t2t_mappings.csv`: table containing the generated text2term mappings.
- `output/{dataset}_mappings.tsv`: table containing mappings extracted from the original dataset.
- `output/{dataset}_results.tsv`: table containing the results of the mappings' comparison.
